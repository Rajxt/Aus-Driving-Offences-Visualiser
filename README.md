# Phone-Related Fines and Arrests in Australia - Data Story

## Overview

Mobile phone usage while driving or in restricted circumstances constitutes a significant road safety and legal compliance issue across Australia. Citizens often lack comprehensive awareness of the varying penalties, enforcement patterns, and demographic trends associated with phone-related offences across different states and territories. Many Australians are unaware of the substantial variations in fines, the age groups most frequently targeted by enforcement, and which jurisdictions have the strictest penalties and highest arrest rates.

The purpose of this website is to address this critical knowledge gap by providing citizens with clear, data-driven insights into phone-related fines and arrests across Australia. Our platform helps users understand enforcement patterns, identify high-risk demographics, and become aware of the legal consequences they may face for phone-related offences in their state or territory.

## Data Source

The data for this research has been sourced from **bitre.gov.au**, utilizing official government datasets on traffic violations, fines, and arrests related to mobile phone usage across Australian states and territories.

## Data Processing

The data has been comprehensively processed using **KNIME**, which has facilitated:
- Data cleaning and standardization across multiple jurisdictions
- Statistical analysis of fine amounts and frequency
- Demographic breakdown by age groups
- Geographic analysis by state and territory


## Key Insights Covered

### Geographic Analysis
- **Enforcement frequency by state**: Analysis of which states issue the most phone-related fines

### Demographic Breakdown
- **Age group analysis**: Detailed examination of which age demographics are most frequently fined
- **Enforcement targeting**: Understanding which age groups face the highest charges 


## Accuracy and Limitations

**Scope Limitations**: The scope of this research is limited to datasets available through data.gov.au. Multiple private or commercial data sources have not been incorporated, which may limit the comprehensiveness of certain analyses. 

**Data Limitations**: Age group specific data is only available for the year 2023

**Temporal Constraints**: Data availability is subject to government reporting cycles and may not reflect the most recent enforcement actions or policy changes.

**Jurisdictional Variations**: Different states and territories may have different reporting standards and definitions for phone-related offences, which could affect direct comparisons. For instance NSW police collects police issued fines but camera issued fines are collected by NSW revenue 

## Technology and AI Usage

**Generative AI**: GenAI has been utilized to:
-- Refine content for headings, subheadings, and aboutUs page
-- To create Home page Hero CSS animations
-- Understand various D3 functions such as geoMercator, .node
